## Applying and designing deep learning techniques
The objective of this project is to implement three widely used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The selected models are VGG16, Xception, and ResNet50. These three models are chosen for their balance of accuracy, speed, and low computational complexity. Xception employs depthwise separable convolutions, making it both efficient and fast while maintaining high accuracy, which is ideal for real-time applications. ResNet50 utilizes residual connections, enabling it to be deep without significantly increasing computational costs, contributing to its strong performance. VGG16, while simpler and with more parameters, features a straightforward architecture that allows for reasonable inference speed.

Collectively, these models provide a solid combination of accuracy and efficiency, making them practical choices for various tasks while consuming fewer resources compared to more complex architectures. Together, these models offer a good mix of accuracy and efficiency, making them practical choices for various tasks while using fewer resources compared to more complex architectures.

These models are implemented using transfer learning on their pre-trained architectures. Furthermore, VGG16 is used to compare the results between transfer learning with the pre-trained model and training the model from scratch to evaluate the performance differences.

TensorFlow is a comprehensive machine learning library that requires specific versions of supporting software, particularly for GPU acceleration. Installing TensorFlow with pip is generally recommended, as pip provides the most up-to-date versions of the library and its dependencies. This ensures compatibility and minimizes potential version conflicts, while conda repositories may contain older versions that could lead to compatibility issues. For this reason, the package requirements and their respective versions are listed below.

python=3.7

## Observations

The evaluation of VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception on selected images from the ImageNet dataset reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each model regarding predicted probabilities and accuracy. ResNet50 demonstrates the highest reliability, consistently achieving high confidence levels in its predictions, such as 99.99% for the "pick" category. VGG16 follows with a solid 98.22% confidence, while Xception trails with 58.77%. This pattern underscores ResNet50’s superior performance across various classes, making it the preferred choice for applications demanding reliable image classification.

Processing time is another critical aspect of model performance. ResNet50 shows slightly longer processing times, averaging around 0.135 seconds, compared to VGG16’s average of approximately 0.124 seconds. While Xception's processing times are often on par with those of ResNet50, they are generally marginally longer. Nonetheless, the combination of high prediction confidence and reasonable processing speeds positions ResNet50 favorably for real-time applications where efficiency is crucial. This trend was consistently observed across all 50,000 images tested with these three CNN models.

In conclusion, while Xception exhibits potential with impressive probabilities for specific categories, its performance can be inconsistent across different classes. This variability suggests that despite its strengths in certain scenarios, ResNet50 emerges as the best-performing model overall, owing to its balance of accuracy and efficiency. The selection of the optimal model should be guided by the specific needs of the application, considering the trade-offs between prediction accuracy and processing speed. Additionally, further exploration into model fine-tuning or ensemble methods may enhance overall performance.
